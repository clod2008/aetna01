At Aetna, our Customs Brokerage Department will help to clear your freight as quickly and efficiently as possible. Upon arrival, all imported shipments must be cleared through U.S. Customs. The law requires that importers pay duty on goods according to the country's current tariff. Because we are full service, customs brokers, we ensure that these payments are made and your shipments are released in the timeliest manner.Our goal is to help make what could be a difficult and time consuming process, as easy as possible.
After we've successfully handled the clearance and release of your freight, we can take care of all the necessary arrangements of getting your freight wherever you need it to be.
